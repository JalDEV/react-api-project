Start Time: 8PM 				End Time: 4AM

Had to take a few hour break from around 10PM - 2PM. Overall spent about 4 hours.

I have a lot of front-end and JavaScript experience, however I'm late to the React train. However, I really enjoy learning and discoverying new tools and frameworks, so I decided to do the React test instead of the vanilla JavaScript. I thought it would be a fun project to get my feet wet and learn as I go. Due to this I wasn't able to get as far into the project as I'd like, however I think there is enough code to show that I have the problem solving skills to visualize a solution, and the apptitude to find a way to impliment it, whatever the language. 

I do think this was a really cool test though, and way better than some of the other things I've been asked to do - as far as providing a good framework to work in and clear goals and specifications.
